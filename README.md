# Luontovahdit backend

Luontovahdit is a map-based app where users can track activity in mining, prospecting, illegal dumping, and logging. Users can log in and create map hotspots and add images and/or comments when they discover relevant activity in the nature.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Node.js
npm
MongoDB
The frontend React application can be run locally independent of the back-end Express.js REST API.
The frontend client by itself can only display the map and some related features.

### Installing

Get the development back-end up and running.

Install Node modules.
```
npm install
```

Example of MongoDB connection specification in local .env file.
```
ATLAS_URI=<your mongoDB (Atlas) short SRV connection string>
PORT=3003
SECRET="<yoursecred>"
```



Start the Node Express with a MongoDB connection.
```
npm start
```
